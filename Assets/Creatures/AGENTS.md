# Creature Assets

Each subfolder represents a creature.  Inside you will typically find:
- `Default/` – prefab data (`unit.prefab` plus images or Spine data).
- `main.script` and `mainClient.script` – server and client logic for the creature.

Creature stats and IDs are referenced in `Assets/Catalogs/Creatures.json`.
