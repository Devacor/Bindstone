# Editor Code

Tools for editing scenes and assets.  Useful when investigating the in‑game editor.

Important files:
- `editor.*` – main editor application logic.
- `componentPanels.*` / `editComponents.*` – UI panels for editing scene graph components.
- `editorSceneGraphPanel.*` – manages the scene hierarchy view.
