# jai_demoreel — a demoscene tech reel written in JaiScript

A cold open and twelve auto-advancing truecolor scenes, six kinds of transition, pixel-font
title cards, an opening number where an eight-dimensional hypercube unfolds over
Escher's hyperbolic plane, shatters into the word JAISCRIPT and slams it into a
wall of rainbow fire, and a finale of fireworks over a neon skyline with the
credits climbing its sky — every effect coded in
`scenes/*.jai`, every frame drawn in **Unicode sextants**, six pixels a cell
(half blocks on request or on very large terminals). A ray tracer, a torus met
by a closed-form quartic, a textured Wolfenstein raycaster, a VoxelSpace terrain flight,
a raytraced forest of lava lamps, a murmuration that flies geometry, a skull on eight legs of inverse
kinematics spinning an orb web, a Navier-Stokes ink tank and the classics. The C++ host (`demoreel_host.cpp`) is a
thin shell: a VT console, a monotonic clock, non-blocking keys, a seeded rng
class, and the frame pump. Everything you see is script.

The reel doubles as a determinism test: `--smoke` hashes the whole frame stream
against a reference. Nine of the twelve scenes split their work across every core
with `parallel_transform`, and the stream stays byte-identical anyway.

## How a frame is drawn

Each scene paints a grid of palette indices in square pixels, and the presenter
in `util.jai` packs them into cells one of two ways:

- **Sextants** (the default): a cell is 2x3 pixels drawn with one of the 64
  Unicode 13 sextant glyphs, fitted as JaiDoom fits them (`vid_row_sext`): the
  cell's brightest pixel is the foreground, its darkest the background, and each
  pixel takes the nearer in luminance. A sextant is 2/3 as wide as it is tall, so
  the grid is three pixels a row tall and one and a half a column wide, and each
  of a cell's two glyph columns shows the grid column nearest it.
- **Half blocks**: a cell is 1x2 pixels through the upper-half-block glyph `▀`:
  the **foreground** truecolor escape paints the top pixel, the **background**
  escape the bottom one (JaiDoom's `vid_row_half`).

`pix half|sext|auto` (`--pix` on `jai_demoreel`) picks; auto takes sextants while
the grid stays within 48,000 pixels (about 160x60 cells) and half blocks above,
and the density map always reads half blocks. Escapes are emitted only when a
color changes along the row, and a cell whose pixels agree collapses to a space
(a background run) or a full block (a foreground run), so smooth regions cost one
byte per cell. Palettes
precompute both escape strings per entry; a transition simply concatenates the
two scenes' tables (the incoming scene's indices shift by an offset) and the
reel's own UI entries ride at the end. `hb_row` is written as a
`parallel_transform` body over captured globals, so the same function serves
the serial loop and, with `HB_WORKERS` set (the standalone runner does on wide
terminals), a parallel presentation.

Text stays crisp on top: the HUD, the scene handle under each title card and
the finale's credits are ordinary glyph rows, and a scene can lay characters on
any cell through the text layer (`txt_put`, `txt_glyph`: a codepoint and a color
per cell, drawn over the cell's darkest pixel). The big title letters themselves
are pixels from a 5x7 font (`FONT5`), typed in with a shine sweeping across, at
the largest scale that fits.

## Run it

From the JaiScript source root, build the runner once:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release --target jaiscript_runner
```

then:

```bash
build/bin/jaiscript examples/demoreel/demoreel.jai
```

(On Windows the runner is `build\bin\jaiscript.exe`.) The native host is the `jai_demoreel` target: `cmake --build build --config Release --target jai_demoreel`, then
`build/bin/jai_demoreel`.

## Build

Part of the JaiScript CMake tree (target `jai_demoreel`):

```
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release --target jai_demoreel
```

The exe prefers the source `scenes/` dir (so hot reload edits the real files),
falling back to `demoreel_scenes/` copied next to the binary.

### No build: the standalone runner

`demoreel.jai` is a pure-script shim that recreates the C++ host contract (the
`ESC` global, `itrunc`/`ifloor`, and a bit-exact script port of the seeded
xorshift64* `Rng` — checked-int64-safe via 16-bit-limb multiplies) and pumps the
reel on the standalone runner — drag-drop it onto `jaiscript.exe` or:

```
jaiscript demoreel.jai                       # the reel, 30 fps, with its soundtrack (q/esc quits; h/f/n/p/space/digits work)
jaiscript demoreel.jai -- color 256          # the reel quantized to the xterm-256 cube (color 24 forces 24-bit)
jaiscript demoreel.jai -- ascii 1            # one density character per cell (no block glyphs)
jaiscript demoreel.jai -- pix half           # half blocks instead of sextants (for a font without them)
jaiscript demoreel.jai -- frames 1700        # headless self-test: smoke frames, sizes + stream hash + timing
jaiscript demoreel.jai -- frames 60 dump P   # also write frames 0/N-2/N-1 to P_<i>.txt (+ P_<i>.bmp, the pixel grid)
jaiscript demoreel.jai -- bench 60           # every scene mid-flight: script ms/frame and KB/frame
jaiscript demoreel.jai -- shot 9 at 4 dump P    # one frame of scene 9 at scene time 4 -> P.txt (as presented) + P.bmp
jaiscript demoreel.jai -- midi cues          # write the soundtrack's cues (one MIDI file a scene) and exit
jaiscript demoreel.jai -- video frames every 2   # the whole reel's frames as 24-bit text, with the cues, for a video
jaiscript demoreel.jai -- music 0            # the reel, silent
jaiscript demoreel.jai -- frames 90 w 120 scene 10 workers 1   # headless with rows drawn in parallel (the reel's default from 100 columns)
```

The soundtrack is procedural synthwave and the scenes hear it (`scenes/music.jai`).
At boot the script composes one cue per scene at 124 bpm: each scene has a mood (a
minor key and a progression of seventh, added-ninth and suspended chords, the keys
travelling so no two neighbours share one; a drum style on the power, electronic or
808 kit: outrun, breakbeat, half time, an ostinato or a driving gallop; General MIDI
instruments for bass, pad, arpeggio and lead; a level of energy). The bass rolls in
sixteenths and walks into each chord change, the gated snare and a clap hit two and
four, every kick ducks the pad and the arpeggio and they swell back over the beat (a
sidechain written as MIDI expression), a gate chops the pad at the peaks, the
arpeggio leans on three, three and two, it and the lead echo on the dotted eighth,
the lead sings a two-bar motif from the reel's seed over each chord's tones, brass
stabs off the beat when the energy is up, electronic toms fill into every fourth
bar, and every third pass through the progression starts from its second half. The
energy builds into each of the scene's declared hits and drops on it: a reverse
cymbal swells and the filters open over the bar before a big hit, a snare roll
climbs through its last half bar, the band falls silent for the last beat, and the
hit lands a crash, a low boom, an orchestra hit and brass on the chord with the bass
dropping under it. Every cut lands with a crash.
The same score is data the scenes query every frame (`cue.kick_env(t)`,
`snare_env`, `hat_env`, `bass_env`, `chord`, `energy`, `hit`, `riser`), so the
pictures move with exactly the music being played, deterministically and with no
audio analysis. Every scene is a whole number of bars and starts on a bar line,
so the cues play back to back: the runner preloads them as MIDI files and
switches the frame a scene's transition starts.

`docs/site_tools/render_reel_video.py` turns the reel into a video with that
soundtrack, an H.264 MP4 and a VP9 WebM: it runs the `video` mode, renders every
kept frame through the examples page's terminal renderer across all cores, plays
the cues back to back through a small numpy synthesizer (each cue's drum kit with
a gated snare, toms and claps, a filtered-saw bass, a detuned pad and a square
arpeggio pumped by the score's sidechain, a vibrato lead, brass stabs, an
orchestra hit, a reverse cymbal), and hands both to ffmpeg, scaling by nearest neighbour so the pixels
stay crisp (`--seconds N` for a short cut, `--frames DIR` to reuse a dump).

Verified: the 1700-frame smoke reel produces the same stream hash and
byte-identical dumped frames under `--backend=vm` and `--backend=interp`.
The shim picks its color depth as `jai_demoreel` does, through the runner's
`env_var`: 24-bit under `COLORTERM=truecolor` (or `24bit`) and in Windows Terminal
(`WT_SESSION`), the xterm-256 cube elsewhere; `color 24`, `color 256` and `ascii 1`
override it. Not ported
from the C++ host: its escape trimming and row-diff redraw (frames present
whole) and `r` hot reload.

On Windows the runner sets the console to UTF-8 and VT output. q, ESC and
Ctrl+C all end the reel with the cursor, the colors and the main screen
restored, on every platform, as `jai_demoreel` does.

## Run

```
jai_demoreel                     # the reel, 30 fps pacing
jai_demoreel --ascii             # one density character per cell, for terminals without block glyphs
jai_demoreel --pix half          # half blocks instead of sextants (--pix sext forces sextants at any size)
jai_demoreel --256color          # force the xterm-256 cube (--truecolor forces 24-bit)
jai_demoreel --smoke             # headless: frame-stream hash + perf
jai_demoreel --smoke --frames N  # smoke frame budget (default 1700)
jai_demoreel --capture I         # print scene I as plain text (ANSI stripped: block glyphs and spaces)
jai_demoreel --capture I --ascii # the same frame as a density map
jai_demoreel --reload-test       # headless hot-reload self-test
jai_demoreel --precompiled       # boot from demoreel.jaibite (saved on first run)
```

Keys while running:

| key | action |
| --- | ------ |
| `r` | hot-reload every `scenes/*.jai` from disk; a band under the HUD names the files that changed, or the file that failed to load with its error |
| `h` | step the HUD: two quiet chips on the bottom row (the scene; the VM's ms per frame, cores and fps), then the full status bar (backend, frame ms split into sim and draw, fps, pixel size) and a key bar that fills as the scene plays, then off |
| `f` | freeze the clock (render keeps running) |
| `n` / `p` / space / arrows | next / previous scene |
| `1`..`9`, `0` | jump straight to a scene (`0` = scene 12, the finale) |
| `q` / `ESC` | quit |

`jai_demoreel` runs one engine, on the VM: it links the library without the
interpreter, so the two backends are compared on the standalone runner
(`--backend=interp`, above). The HUD shows the backend and its frame cost. Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Break and SIGTERM
end the reel through the same exit as `q`: the cursor, the colors, the
main screen and (on Linux and macOS) the terminal's input mode come back.

## The scenes

| # | scene | what it is |
| - | ----- | ---------- |
| 1 | EIGHT | JaiScript in eight dimensions, the opening number: a music video on the soundtrack's 124 bpm, with no title card. It names the language, counts a bar in, then counts the language in, ONE (scripting), TWO (serialization), THREE (reflection), FOUR (hot reload), FIVE (parallel), SIX (signals), SEVEN (debugging), EIGHT (embedding), four bars a slide (`scenes/show.jai`): the counted word slams in on a sweep of light, a code card slides in and types a real snippet in syntax colours (every script one runs on the runner), a live demonstration plays beside it (Spark objects, an archive round trip, a reflect:: inspector, a file edited mid-loop, eight cores on one frame, a signal fanning out, a paused debugger, C++ and script trading calls), captions run along the lower third and a checklist lights; every slide opens one more axis of an 8-cube (256 vertices, 1024 edges) turning in a window above the demonstration as a world turns in Fez, in eased quarter-turns snapping on the beat, on Escher's hyperbolic plane: the {8,3} tiling in the Poincaré disk, folded per pixel by its three mirrors, three-coloured, opening ring by ring with the dimensions and mirrored through the circle at infinity to fill the screen; with all eight shown the cube takes the screen, the snaps double up every half beat and the whole scene turns, swirls and ripples as one per-pixel map while the plane warps; the cube shatters into a vortex of sparks that wind onto JAISCRIPT, which slams in with a flash, shockwaves and a shake as the fire wall erupts (the fire scene in `fire.jai`), the flames pumping in rainbow on the beat with the plane behind them, and the wall burns until it melts onto DONUT; 41 bars |
| 2 | DONUT | a product shot that drops in on the beat: one ray per pixel, cast in the donut's own frame and met with the torus by a quartic solved in closed form (nothing is marched); the dough, the icing down to a wavy edge with drips, the sprinkles and their shadows are painted on the torus by its two angles; a glossy walnut table reflects it (the same solve from the camera's mirror image) and takes its soft shadow, before a cyclorama with drifting bokeh. Scored to its cue: a glint traces the silhouette in the dark over the riser, the donut lands as the key light slams on, hops on every kick with its sprinkles popping, winds up over the second riser, is tossed on the big hit and flips end over end through a storm of falling donuts, is caught flat on the table, and the camera cranes up for the hero shot, the whole iced ring from above with its hole dead centre for the cut; it renders within a 26,000-pixel budget and scales up; ten bars |
| 3 | JULIA | the whole Julia set, morphing in frame: the constant c is steered through its fixed point's multiplier (c = lambda/2 - lambda^2/4) along a path that never leaves the Mandelbrot set, so the set stays one connected shape as it changes: a fat blob swells four ears, trades them for Douady's rabbit, starves to a six-armed dendrite, slides along the cardioid's edge through San Marco, a spiral dragon, the basilica and a Siegel disk, and climbs the quarter bulb to an eight-armed star; every pixel iterates z and its derivative across all cores (half the rows, the other half mirrored, since the set is its own half turn): the smooth escape count picks the hue, the distance estimate draws the boundary as a white-hot rim a pixel wide however thin the filament, the potential's gradient lights the bands as a relief, and the inside is ringed by where its orbit settles; the camera frames the whole shape, level; kicks punch the zoom and the light, the chord turns the palette, and the two big hits dive thirteen-fold into a dendrite's junction and spin round it; ten bars |
| 4 | LAVALAMP | a forest of lava lamps raytraced in 3D: an endless grid of lamps on black glass, each a surface of revolution (a steel cone base, a tapered glass vessel, a steel cap) solved exactly as seven cone frustums once its bounding cylinder says the ray might hit, the ray walking the grid cell by cell (a 2D DDA) so the cost per pixel stays flat however many lamps are in view; the glass carries a rim and a graded glint in the lamp's own hue and bends the ray, and inside it a 3D metaball field (seven blobs rising off the heater and sinking as they cool, stretched by their speed, a pool on the base, a drip under the cap) is bracketed and bisected along the bent ray, the wax lit from the field's gradient and the liquid glowing in the lamp's colour; each lamp takes one of three blob simulations turned to its own quarter and its own colour family; the floor mirrors the near lamps over pools of their light, every lamp blooms into the haze and distance fogs it all; rays are traced on a lattice of every second pixel in parallel rows and neighbours that agree are interpolated, within a 17,000-pixel budget and scaled up; the camera flies a spline with a mark on every bar line: out of one lamp's wax, up into a crane over the field on the first big hit, low between the rows, a dive into another lamp's wax on the second, a corkscrew blast back out on the third and a race along a lane; the wax swells on the kick, shifts hue with the chord, a rainbow wave rolls over the field and each big hit sends a ring of white heat across the floor and through the lamps it passes; eleven bars |
| 5 | PIPEDREAM | the 3D Pipes screensaver homage on a synthwave set, flown by a real camera: six chrome pipes grow one segment per tick through a 16x12x16 voxel volume, never intersecting, glossy elbow balls at every turn; every frame the whole sculpture is projected from the camera, each straight run a capsule impostor (a sphere swept between its end voxels, radius and 1/z interpolated along the screen segment, clipped to the near plane) and each elbow a ball, binned into bands of rows drawn across every core against a depth buffer; per pixel the nearest axis point gives a normal whose world-space reflection reads the set (sky, the horizon's hard bright band, the floor, a white rim wherever a grazing ray meets the sun), with specular, fog and a depth nudge so crossings intersect; the set is 3D too: a striped sun low in one direction, a sky graded by elevation, a floor whose grid lines stay one pixel wide rushing in with the energy, glossy with the pipes' mirror images and the sun's reflection thinning as the view steepens; ~2% of elbows are the jackodile's rainbow eye. Scored to its cue over eleven bars: generation one grows as the camera orbits up from the floor, swinging round on every bar line, and fills on bar 3 (a glint, a flash, a sweep); a CRT beam wipes it while the camera rises to a new high angle, generation two grows round a tunnel it may never enter as the camera cranes down, and fills on bar 7; the camera dives into the tunnel and flies through the sculpture toward the sun, lunging on every kick and banking, bursts out, swings round on bar 9, cranes up into the riser, and on bar 10 a white-hot surge races along every pipe in the order it grew while the camera sweeps round to put the sun behind the sculpture for the cut; the kick punches the lens and lights the floor grid, the snare flares the chrome, every chord recolours the sun, the growing tips burn white-hot and shower sparks, and the frame rolls, punched on the hits |
| 6 | BOIDS | a starling murmuration over a lake at sunset that flies geometry: 1,500 birds in 3D, each chasing its own place in the figure the flock is flying while it keeps its distance from and matches the heading of its nearest neighbours (at most seven, read from a uniform grid hashed every frame; the steering runs in parallel chunks); a figure is a set of moving places handed over in a wave along the flock, so each shape unravels into the next as a stream: the murmuration's folding sheet, then on a hit every two bars a torus of rolling coils, a double helix with its rungs, a four-lane figure eight, a two-armed spiral galaxy and a banded sphere that hangs over the sun as a black sun; a falcon stoops through its heart on the last hit, the sphere bursts with a flash and a ring of light across the sky, and the flock settles into three rings tumbling through one another like a gyroscope; far birds are specks of haze whose darkness stacks, near birds black chevrons with beating wings, the lake mirrors the flock beside the sun's glitter path, and no bird comes near the water; the kick swells the figure and the sun's rays, the snare sparks the glitter; 15 bars |
| 7 | GLOBHUNTER | a Wolfenstein-style DDA raycaster over an authored 24x27 keep of three-wide halls under a two-unit vault, textured (coursed stone, mossy stone, fluted gold and a banner of animated rainbow fire, 16x32 textures grown in script; flagstones below and oak planks above cast per pixel) and lit by flickering torches through a light map, warm in the pools and cold blue in the gloom; billboard Grublins and Orglis brutes are lit as spheres per pixel with eyes that glow in the dark, and every monster stands farther from every wall than its billboard reaches and shorter than the vault, so a wall only ever hides a monster behind it; the camera hunts: it swings onto a mark in clear sight, bobs as it walks and fires on the beat, with recoil, a muzzle flash that lights the hall, a rainbow tracer, hit-stop, goo that bursts in 3D and bounces off the flagstones, callouts and a pixel-font kill counter; the big hit on bar five floods the hall with light and calls FRENZY in bullet time, on bar seven a BOSS GLOB twice a brute's size rises in the open floor of a nine-by-nine arena, takes a hit on every beat and bursts on bar nine, then the keep falls: RUN, the torches strobe, stone falls from the vault, and on bar twelve the east wall blows in and the camera walks out into daylight; thirteen bars |
| 8 | CANYONRUN | the Comanche (1992) VoxelSpace algorithm flown as a golden-hour drone shot: a 512x512 wrapping heightmap by diamond-square, a U-shaped gorge carved along a wrapping meander, the land terraced into mesas and stepped cliffs; the colormap is baked with light in parallel rows (a low sun's shadows marched across the height field, diffuse from the normals, ambient occlusion from the height field against its blur) and materials (river, wet sand, a green floor, scrub, mesa tops, pale peaks, ten strata colours); 120 geometric depth steps of 16.16 fixed-point marching with a per-column y-buffer and a sub-texel jitter per column and step, cliff faces painted per pixel with the rock layer at the height each row looks at (integer inverse projection), grain on rock and ground, twelve haze banks; the river mirrors the sky about each column's horizon with ripples and the sun's glitter, the sky is a perspective cloud deck lit by the sunset; the camera skims the river, banks through the bends, climbs out over the rim for the reveal and dives back in It plays to its cue: the climb out runs through bar three to the reveal on bar four's downbeat, where the sun flares with the hit, the dive back in starts on bar six, and the camera nods on the kick and leans on the snare. Over it: dust streaks rush past the lens (longer on the kick), a flock of birds beats across the sky, and each hit bursts a fan of god rays from the sun across the sky; the drone flies faster and skims lower. After the dive on bar six the drone skims the river; from bar nine the gorge pinches into a slot canyon between towering shadowed walls, the river racing white for a lip, and on bar eleven's downbeat the drone shoots over the falls into a wide basin, drops to skim a lake mirroring the sky, then climbs out and turns into the sun as it blazes over the rim; the kick nods the nose and punches the lens in, the snare leans the drone. It runs twelve bars. |
| 9 | CHROME | the Amiga Juggler's grandchild: a ray tracer, one ray per pixel across every core — three tinted chrome spheres bounce on a checkerboard running to a hazy horizon, one reflection bounce, hard shadows, a sun glint; the ray returns WHAT IT SAW as a class and each sphere looks that up in its own tinted copy of the class table; the middle sphere is glass (Snell refraction in and out at index 1.5, the world upside down through it, a mirror rim at grazing angles), the dark tiles are polished and show the spheres standing over them, the camera cranes up from a floor-level dolly, whips around at the middle and pulls back high as the bounces fall into step, and star sparkles bloom on the brightest glints It plays to its cue: every bounce is a parabola landing on a beat (one sphere on each beat, one every other, one on the offbeats), the camera rides the riser in and whips around on bar three's downbeat, and in bar four the spheres fall into step until they land as one on bar five; the glints flare on the hits and twinkle on the snare. A ring of six small chrome satellites orbits the big sphere, spinning up with the energy and the kick and flung wide on each hit (one bounding sphere spares rays that miss the ring), a low sun rides in every mirror, and each hit sends a glowing shockwave racing across the checkerboard from under the spheres. Through bar seven the three whirl inward ever faster and crash together on bar eight's downbeat (a big hit that whites the frame out) into one giant faceted mirror ball: every tile mirrors one piece of the world, whole tiles flash on the kick, and the ball throws wheeling rings of light spots across the checkerboard that swell on the kick; the camera dives in around it and whips back on the bar-nine accent. The kick punches the lens in and the hits shake the camera's roll. It runs ten bars. |
| 10 | OSSUARY | a short horror story in twelve bars: a skull on eight bone legs lowers asleep down one thread across a round window of moonlit haze; on bar 2 its eyes catch fire and it throws an orb web in two bars, a spoke every sixteenth note and a ring every eighth; a golden moth flutters in and strikes the silk on bar 6, the strike ringing out through the web, and the hunter runs it down, winds it into a cocoon, walks home, rears, and on bar 10 leaps at the lens and holds the frame, jaw snapping on the kick. Painted back to front with no depth buffer: the window and wall copied from a map baked a row at a time as the camera first sees it, the web as lines whose knots breathe and flash with the kick, the moth as triangles, the legs as tapered spans posed by two-bone inverse kinematics in a tetrapod gait, the skull and jaw as sprites baked from a height field at three sizes |
| 11 | MAELSTROM | neon ink in black water, seen from straight above and simulated with Jos Stam's stable fluids (vorticity confinement, warm-started SOR pressure, semi-Lagrangian advection; the flow on a grid a third of the pixel resolution, the ink on a grid twice as fine, carried by the same flow in parallel rows) and drawn as marbling: the amount of ink picks a place along a row of eight neon tubes with dark water between them, so the ink's contours glow as crisp bands that the flow folds and no stirring blends to mud; the tank opens banded like Jupiter, opposing jets rolling the bands into billows; a counter-rotating pair of vortices folds them while six nozzles orbit, three pouring ink on the kick and three drawing it out on the snare; one whirlpool takes over and sweeps the bands round as spiral arms, reverses with every tube trading its colour, and a drain opens that pulls the ink inward while the camera dives and rolls into its white eye; the hits land as rings that shove the ink outward and flash the picture negative; ten bars |
| 12 | FINALE | fireworks over a skyline that reads the soundtrack, and the credits: a night city stands on black water, every tower a level meter for one voice of the score (kick, snare, hats, bass, arpeggio, lead), its windows lit from the street up with a peak light riding above; shells climb from behind the towers and burst on the beat as chrysanthemums, tilted rings, willows weeping gold, palms, double shells and five-point stars; a shell is a table of directions thrown from one point, slowed by drag and pulled down by gravity, so its flight is a function of its age and the scene replays to any moment; the water mirrors all of it; the show builds for eight bars, the credits climb the sky between shells kept to the flanks, a barrage crosses the sky, and after a beat of dark one last shell bursts into sparks that settle into JAISCRIPT before the picture dithers to black; 24 bars |

Between scenes, two beats from the bar line, each scene hands over its own way:
EIGHT's fire wall melts like Doom onto DONUT, the lens zooms through the hole of
DONUT's hero shot into JULIA, JULIA swirls into the lamps, the wax ripples into
the chrome pipes, the pipes iris onto the flock, the flock melts into GLOBHUNTER,
the hunt zooms out over the canyon, the canyon ripples into CHROME, the glass
shatters into OSSUARY, the web swirls into the ink, the ink dives into FINALE and
FINALE's black sky irises back to EIGHT. The
motion transitions read the departing frame through a moving map (a turning
zoom, tiles spinning away, a ring wave, a vortex); the wipes merge two grids per
pixel into the combined palette. A title card with a demoscene handle opens
every scene but EIGHT for one bar, in one of three styles taking turns (a band opening
from the middle, a shutter closing from both sides, a glitch slipping on the
hats), pumping on the kick. A scene can set `pixel_budget`: past it the scene
renders smaller and the reel scales it up, so the heaviest scenes hold their
frame rate on large terminals.

The reel opens cold (`scenes/intro.jai`, four bars, played once): a dead signal
rolls and flickers over the riser and a CRT line powers on, JAISCRIPT slams in on
the first downbeat split into red and cyan ghosts with a chromatic shockwave over a
warping starfield of blue and rose stars, a violet glow breathing behind the letters
on the kick, the tagline types itself, and on the second impact the logo bursts into
sparks of its own colours behind a second shockwave, streams into the warp and
whites out into EIGHT. Every cut lands with a dithered white flash on
its bar line, and every big hit lands on the whole frame: over the bar before it an
iris closes in on the picture, tightest through the score's beat of silence, and the
hit throws it open with a shake.

The reel hot-reloads itself on screen: EIGHT's FOUR slide turns a star with
`live_spin()` (defined in `show.jai`), and on the slide's beat it imports
`scenes/live/spin_tweaked.jai`, which redefines the function. The engine swaps the
code under the running scene; the star keeps its angle and turns six times as fast
from the next frame. A module runs once a process, so a second pass through the
reel finds the tweak already live and says so; `r` re-executes `show.jai` and
puts it back.

## Measured numbers

The whole reel on the standalone runner (100x40 cells = 150x120 = 18,000 sextant
pixels per frame, seed 20260705, fixed dt 1/30, transitions included, smoke durations
of 3 s per scene) reports its own timing: `jaiscript demoreel.jai -- frames 1700`
prints the render cost per frame (`demo_frame` alone: update, render and
presentation), the cost including the shim's per-byte script hash of every
frame, and the mean frame size (46 KB). Measure it on a quiet Release build.

Per scene, three seconds in (`-- bench 20` on the VM, `-- bench 10` on the
interpreter, no transitions, same size):

| scene | VM ms | interp ms | KB/frame |
| ----- | ----- | --------- | -------- |
| EIGHT | 6.6 | 78.3 | 7 |
| DONUT | 6.2 | 43.4 | 54 |

Every scene holds 30 fps on the VM, the raytraced LAVALAMP heaviest at about 13 ms and
CHROME next at under 9; at 120x40 sextants with rows drawn in parallel no scene costs
more than 15 ms three seconds in.

- Parity: frame streams **byte-identical** across backends over 1,700 frames,
  the cold open and every one of the twelve scenes: shim stream hash `490122693` on
  both. The C++ host's `--smoke` hash is FNV-1a 64 over the same frames:
  `f087d42d0b3011b4` (the host's HUD
  is off in smoke, so its frames are the shim's bytes).
- `--reload-test` re-executes every scene file into the engine. The
  presenter's globals live in `util.jai`, so a reload resets them and the reel
  re-binds them on the next frame; a reload mid-transition cancels the
  transition (the live scene rebuilds), so no scene reads a reset buffer.

### Scoreboard

`ossuary_bench/` keeps the original OSSUARY (the skull-spider on the morphing
gyroid, before it spun its web) as a frozen pair: `skull_shaped.jai`, tuned for
the VM, and `skull_natural.jai`, the same algorithms and the same frames written
the way a user would write them (scene hash `1aba3d7537895828` from both at
`--pix half --workers 1`), without the spellings chosen to fit the VM's fast
paths (one `sk_world`, the warp's amplitude read left of its sine, ternary folds,
one `sk_crown` holding its flames, the row pushing `sk_trace`'s result). The
ratio of their serial OSSUARY rows, natural over shaped, measures how general
the VM's fast path is: at 1.0 plain code runs as fast as code written for the
VM. Drop either one into a copy of the scenes directory as `skull.jai`:

```
cp -r scenes /tmp/shaped_scenes && cp ossuary_bench/skull_shaped.jai /tmp/shaped_scenes/skull.jai
cp -r scenes /tmp/natural_scenes && cp ossuary_bench/skull_natural.jai /tmp/natural_scenes/skull.jai
jai_demoreel --perf 30 --scene 9 --backend vm --workers 1 --pix half --scenes /tmp/shaped_scenes   # shaped
jai_demoreel --perf 30 --scene 9 --backend vm --workers 1 --pix half --scenes /tmp/natural_scenes  # natural
```

## Console performance

Frames carry two colors per cell. At 100x40 in sextants they average about 46 KB,
from 36 KB for CHROME to 91 KB for CANYONRUN, whose shading changes nearly every
cell; EIGHT's slides come to 7 KB and the reel's largest frame to 106 KB.
Legacy conhost parses VT ~16x slower than Windows Terminal, which is what the
host's post-processing in `demoreel_host.cpp` is for (scenes and the `--smoke` stream
are untouched by it, so parity hashes don't move):

- **Escape trimming.** Scripts already emit a color escape only when a palette
  index changes; the host additionally drops any SGR group that wouldn't change
  terminal state, and (default on conhost) rewrites 24-bit colors to the xterm-256
  cube — shorter escapes and coarser quanta = longer runs. `--truecolor` keeps
  24-bit with per-channel merge tolerance (`--tol N`, default 8); `--no-filter`
  is the byte-exact legacy stream. The filter tracks foreground and background
  separately, which is exactly the half-block stream's shape.
- **Terminal detection.** `COLORTERM=truecolor` (or `24bit`) and Windows
  Terminal (`WT_SESSION`) get 24-bit color with tolerance merging; every other
  terminal (macOS Terminal.app, the Linux console, legacy conhost) gets the
  xterm-256 cube. Conhost also shows a one-line tip on the title card ("Windows
  Terminal renders this reel much faster"). `--truecolor` and `--256color`
  override the choice, and `--ascii` replaces the block glyphs with one density
  character per cell (its brightness the cell's, its color the cell's hue at
  full value) for terminals without the block glyphs; rows carrying text keep
  their characters.
- **One buffered write per frame**, via `WriteConsoleA` on a real console.
- **`--diff`** row-diff redraw: only rows that changed since the last frame are
  rewritten (cursor-move + row). Not the default — most scenes change every
  pixel every frame.

The HUD's headline frame cost is `sim + draw` (script update + frame string,
plus the console write), split out so you can see which side you're bound on.
`--bench N --scene I` runs N real frames and reports the same split headlessly
(`--bench-out FILE` to save it).

## Live coding

1. Run `jai_demoreel`.
2. Open `scenes/lava.jai` in an editor; change the wax colors (the
   `gfx.rainbow_rgb` phase in `build`), or the blob speeds in `update`.
3. Press `r` in the console window.

The engine re-executes every scene file (hot reload with instance migration) and
the current scene rebuilds — the change appears without restarting. `main.jai` is
deliberately never reloaded: it owns the persistent globals.

For three seconds a green band under the HUD names the files whose text changed
and the scene that was rebuilt (`RELOADED  lava.jai  LAVALAMP rebuilt at 4.2 s`).
An edit that does not parse or check loads nothing: the file keeps running its
previous code, every other file still reloads, and a red band shows the first
error with its source line and caret for eight seconds. Fix it and press `r`
again.

## Determinism / parity

`--smoke` runs N frames headless at a fixed dt, FNV-1a-hashing every returned
frame; `--expect H` fails the run unless the stream hash is H. All scene randomness
goes through the host's seeded xorshift `Rng` class (the presentation-only hashes
are integer arithmetic on pixel coordinates), and `parallel_transform` returns
rows in order, so the hash holds at every worker count. The backends' parity runs
on the standalone runner (`--backend=vm` and `--backend=interp` above). Env
helpers: `DEMOREEL_SMOKE_FULLDUR=1` (full interactive scene durations),
`DEMOREEL_DUMP_FRAME=N` (write frame N to a file for
diffing), `DEMOREEL_TRACE=1` (per-frame progress for crash localization).
Deliberately NOT part of the main test suite.

## --precompiled

`engine->jaibite()` parses the concatenated scene source once; `--precompiled`
saves the parsed AST as `demoreel.jaibite` on first boot and loads it afterwards
(`jaibite_load` re-interns symbols per engine, so one file serves every engine).

## Captures

Stripped of color a half-block frame is only `▀`, `█` and spaces, so these are
brightness maps of the pixel grid (one character per terminal cell, the two
pixels averaged; `-- shot I at T dump P` writes the full-color `P.bmp`).

## Idioms

- **`var&` for hot arrays and the frame grid.** Assignment copies arrays and objects, so
  `var alias = field_array;` is a copy and writes through it never reach the field.
  `var& alias = field_array;` binds a reference; the scenes bind their hot arrays this way at
  the top of `update` and `render`, and a scene paints through `render(var& grid)`.
- **Compound element stores.** `arr[i] += v` resolves the element once, where a read followed
  by a write resolves it twice; MAELSTROM's jets, whirlpool and pressure solve write the flow
  that way.
- **Two resolutions.** MAELSTROM's pressure solve is most of a fluid frame, so the flow runs on
  a grid a third of the pixel resolution (a ninth of the cells); the ink, which carries the
  detail, rides the same flow on a grid twice as fine, and the camera samples it bilinearly.
- **A scene's `replay`.** A jump (`--perf`, `--capture`, a shot) replays a scene's updates so it
  arrives mid-flight; three seconds rebuild most scenes, while MAELSTROM's water is its whole
  history, so it sets `replay` to its full length and a shot at second 13 shows second 13.
