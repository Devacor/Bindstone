# jai_gloom — GLOOM: a terminal DOOM-like, all JaiScript

A real-time 2.5D raycast shooter in the terminal — one tight four-map episode of
corridors, keycards, secrets, and things that roar before they charge — written
**entirely in JaiScript**. The C++ host (`gloom_host.*` + `gloom_adapter_jai.cpp`)
is the same thin shell as the crawler/demoreel: a VT console, held-key input, a
seeded `Rng`, a monotonic clock, flags as globals — split into a shared,
runtime-agnostic core and a per-language adapter. Everything else — the raycaster, the sub-cell renderer, enemy
brains, weapons, particles, the episode, the autopilot — is script.

GLOOM is the crawler's bigger sibling and a deliberate dogfood of the language's
larger features: **`parallel_transform`** drives the wall rays and the particle pool,
**coroutine handles living in fields** drive every enemy brain and the demo pilot,
`new`/`shared_ptr` holds the world and its registries, and template strings (with
`:spec` formats) build the HUD.

## Run it

From the JaiScript source root, build the runner once:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release --target jaiscript_runner
```

then:

```bash
build/bin/jaiscript examples/gloom/gloom.jai
```

(On Windows the runner is `build\bin\jaiscript.exe`.) The native host is the `jai_gloom` target: `cmake --build build --config Release --target jai_gloom`, then
`build/bin/jai_gloom`.

## The look

GLOOM draws in two looks over one renderer:

- **showcase** (the default when you play): each floor has its own lighting. Torchlight tints what is near, distance
  fades into the floor's haze, and walls turned from the light take a cool shadow. Walls carry real textures: staggered
  bricks, riveted plates, conduits, cracked blocks, plank doors whose lock lights glow in the dark, and an exit switch
  over hazard stripes. Floor and ceiling fade to the same haze at the horizon. Sprites keep more light than walls so a
  threat reads down a dark corridor, and their eyes, the spitter's gob and every projectile glow at full brightness.
  The gun is in your hand at the bottom of the view, swaying as you walk and kicking on every shot. Under the view sit a
  status bar and a panel with big numerals, bars, a face that bleeds as you do, the arms rack and keycards. The title,
  floor tally (the numbers count up), death and victory pages are pixel art too.
- **reference** (`--look reference`): the frames of [reference/README.md](reference/README.md) section 4.2, the ones
  the Lua, LuaJIT, Squirrel and ChaiScript ports reproduce byte for byte. `--smoke` draws it unless told otherwise, so
  the published comparison times the same frames in every language.

Both looks run the same simulation and the same per-pixel renderer: everything that differs is a table built at boot
or on map load (wall tones, texture strips, sprite shading, particle colors), plus the gun and the panel. The view is a
pixel grid blitted through **sub-cell block glyphs**:

| mode | pixels/cell | glyphs | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--pix half` | 1x2 | `▀` | square pixels, cheapest |
| `--pix quad` | 2x2 | `▘▚▟█…` | **default**; 2 colors/cell by luminosity partition |
| `--pix sext` | 2x3 | `🬀…🬻` | needs a Unicode-13 font (Cascadia Mono in Windows Terminal) |
| `--ascii` | 1x1 | ` .:-=+*#%@` | for terminals without block glyphs (the Linux text console) |

Every color the game shows is interned once into a palette (pixel grids store small indices; the row builders emit
prebuilt escapes only when a cell's colors change). The escapes are 24-bit where the terminal has 24-bit color (on
Windows, and wherever `COLORTERM` is `truecolor` or `24bit`) and the nearest xterm-256 color elsewhere; `--truecolor`
and `--256color` override the guess.

## Build & run

Part of the normal JaiScript CMake build (`JAISCRIPT_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON`).

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release --target jai_gloom   # PLAY THIS ONE
cmake --build build --config Debug --target jai_gloom     # debug iteration
```

Play the Release exe in **Windows Terminal** (truecolor + fast VT). The exe
prefers the source `scripts/` dir; a `gloom_scripts/` copy sits next to the
binary.

```bash
jai_gloom.exe                        # seed 666, VM backend, quad pixels, the showcase look
jai_gloom.exe --pix sext             # 2x3 pixels per cell (font permitting)
jai_gloom.exe --256color             # a terminal without 24-bit color (macOS Terminal.app)
jai_gloom.exe --ascii                # a terminal without block glyphs
jai_gloom.exe --look reference       # the frames the ports draw
jai_gloom.exe --seed 7
jai_gloom.exe --workers 0            # serial script loop instead of parallel_transform
jai_gloom.exe --bench 300            # autopilot plays while you read ms/frame numbers
```

| key | action |
|---|---|
| `w` / `s` | move forward / back |
| `a` / `d` | strafe |
| `left` / `right` | turn |
| `space` / `ctrl` | fire |
| `e` | use — doors, suspicious walls, the exit switch |
| `shift` | run |
| `1` `2` `3` | pistol / scattergun / hexcaster |
| `m` | automap overlay |
| `esc` or Ctrl+C | quit |

On Windows the movement keys are honest held-key state (`GetAsyncKeyState`), so
strafe-running while turning and firing works like it should. A POSIX terminal
sends key presses but no releases: a key counts as held while its auto-repeat
keeps arriving, a shifted letter means run, and space fires. Quitting, by `esc`
or Ctrl+C, restores the screen, the cursor and the colors.

The frame loop starts frames on a fixed grid of deadlines and treats a frame
that arrived within a sixth of the period as exactly one period, so the 30 Hz
simulation advances one tick per 30 fps frame instead of beating against timer
jitter.

### No C++ host: the standalone runner

`gloom.jai` is a drag-drop shim for the standalone `jaiscript.exe` runner: it
supplies the host API of reference/README.md section 2 in pure script (a bit-exact
xorshift64\* `Rng` under checked overflow, `host_log`/`itrunc`/`ifloor`/`utf8`/
`ESC`, the `HOST_*` globals) on top of the runner's console IO, then loads
`scripts/` and runs the host pump. Flags go after `--`:

```bash
jaiscript.exe gloom.jai                          # play (esc quits)
jaiscript.exe gloom.jai -- --smoke --ticks 300   # headless parity self-test vs section 3.5
jaiscript.exe gloom.jai -- --bench 300           # autopilot + sim/draw split
jaiscript.exe gloom.jai -- --256color            # the shim cannot read COLORTERM: say so
```

`--smoke` exits 0 only when `STATE_HASH` matches the reference checkpoint
table.

### The same game, written idiomatically

`../gloom_idiomatic` is GLOOM as you would write it today: subsystem classes
(World, Player, Renderer, Hud, Pilot), an enemy hierarchy whose subclasses
override one coroutine brain, typed records (`Input`, `Particle`, `WallChunk`,
`Billboard`), enums and `math::ivec2` paths. It draws the same frames and
reaches the same `STATE_HASH` in both looks, so the native host plays it too:

```bash
jai_gloom.exe --scripts ../gloom_idiomatic/scripts
jai_gloom.exe --smoke --ticks 300 --scripts ../gloom_idiomatic/scripts   # the hashes above
jaiscript.exe ../gloom_idiomatic/gloom_idiomatic.jai                     # or its own shim
```

## The game

Four maps: **DIMLIT ANTECHAMBER** (grunts, and a wall that isn't), **COOLANT
WARRENS** (spitters behind coolant vats, a red lock), **THE HEX FOUNDRY** (the
hexcaster lives here, behind the blue lock the turrets watch), **GLOOM'S THRONE**
(him). Kills / secrets / par-time tally after each floor; health, armor, three
ammo pools, keycards; a face that grins when you pick up a new gun.

Enemies (each brain is a `coroutine` **method** whose handle lives in a field on
the enemy itself — phase state is coroutine-frame locals, pain interrupts by
discarding the handle mid-phase):

- **GRUNT** — dozes until it sees or hears you, roars (it commits), then zigzag
  charges into a lunge with a real windup.
- **SPITTER** — holds a range band, orbits sideways, telegraphs a green gob.
- **TURRET** — dormant metal until it has line of sight; wakes, 3-round bursts.
  Break line of sight and it goes back to wary idle — its coroutine never forgets.
- **THE WARDEN** — stalks and lobs hollow fire; under half health he goes
  double-volley and calls the family. Exactly once.

Weapons: pistol (accurate, honest), **SCATTERGUN** (6 pellets, crowd opinions),
**HEXCASTER** (a projectile that detonates into a particle bloom and area damage —
including yours, standing in your own spell is a choice).

## parallel_transform

Three systems run through `parallel_transform` every tick — two pure bodies in
`pure.jai` (element + locals only, math whitelist) and one captured-reads body
in `render.jai`:

- **Wall rays** — shared inputs ride inside every element, so elements are
  column *chunks* (16 of them), each carrying the map snapshot packed
  15-tiles-per-int64; the DDA inner loop is pure shift/mask. One ray per cell
  column; sprites and particles keep full sub-cell resolution. This is the
  hand-chunking reference shape; a body with captured reads could read a global
  snapshot instead.
- **Particles** — the 288-slot pool is a flat value array stepped by one pure
  function (fixed timestep baked in as a literal).
- **Glyph rows (quad)** — `gloom_row_quad(ry)` reads the CAPTURED pixel grid
  (borrow tier: zero-copy) and palette tables (per-worker snapshots); see
  "Captured reads in the glyph rows" below.

`--workers 0` runs the same functions in a plain serial loop — determinism
across worker counts holds by construction (`--smoke` hashes are identical at
any `--workers`).

Measured (min of 3 interleaved runs, quad, seed 666, 300 ticks, `--smoke`
headless ms/tick, on a loaded development machine; every row hash-identical):

| workers (quad) | VM ms/tick |
|---|---|
| 0 (serial script loops) | 45.3 |
| 1 | 37.3 |
| 4 | 35.3 |
| 8 | 33.0 |

Treat ±10% as machine noise: measure on a quiet machine, or measure twice. The
[performance guide](../../docs/site/embedding/11-performance.html) covers
measuring JaiScript.

At four workers what stays serial is the per-frame palette snapshots, the
barrier's all-primitive scan of the 13.6k-int grid, and the paint stages.
`--pix half` emits more bytes per frame than quad (35.6 KB vs 21.5 KB): a flat
quad cell is a 1-byte space on background, while every half-mode cell is a
3-byte half-block glyph.

### Captured reads in the glyph rows

`parallel_transform` captured reads (docs/site/guide/09-containers-strings.html, "Parallel loops") let a body
READ enclosing globals, so the quad glyph-row builder is a per-row function
over `ROWIDX` reading the pixel grid as a captured **borrow** (`PIX` is a flat
all-primitive int array touched only by subscript — zero copies, raw element
reads; the escape-string palettes `PAL_FG`/`PAL_BG` snapshot per worker per
frame). Captures resolve global names, so the grid is the global `PIX`, with
`VW`, `VH` and `ROWIDX` beside it. `--workers 0` runs the same row function in
a serial loop; frame bytes are **byte-identical** at every worker count, and
the STATE_HASH reference checkpoints hold (3000 ticks → 4080154357, seed 7 →
1696980843).

## Determinism

`--smoke` runs the seeded autopilot headless for N ticks on the VM and reports a
per-tick FNV `STATE_HASH` (player, enemies, particles, rng state) AND a hash of
every rendered frame string; both hold at any worker count:

```bash
jai_gloom.exe --smoke --ticks 6000
jai_gloom.exe --smoke --ticks 6000 --workers 8
jai_gloom.exe --smoke --ticks 300 --look showcase
```

At 300 ticks, seed 666, the reference look's frames hash to `7fecc09815bb64e0`
and the showcase look's to `6559224cca20d1f0`; `STATE_HASH` is 3580805725 under
both, since the look never touches the simulation. `tools/ci/gates.sh gloom` checks
all three.

The autopilot is itself a coroutine handle in a Game field: it fights what it
sees, loots what it can absorb, hunts the secrets it "remembers", opens what its
keycards allow, pulls the exit switch, and — on the throne floor — goes and has
words with the landlord.
