// The region IR (docs/typed_regions_design.md "The contract", out/fable/plan_middle_end.md): a closed loop's
// canonical operations, one per instruction of the general form, over cells. vm_compiler::lower_typed_ops
// translates a loop into a region_ir and emits the cell copy from it; this module holds what every pass
// consults: the operation set, the region's control flow graph, the verifier (must-define over the graph,
// the snapshot spans, the container bindings never written), the listing and the liveness of compiler
// values per copy instruction. Cells are the registers and the fallback contract (a miss flushes dirty
// cells by liveness and re-runs the general form from the origin), so the IR keeps cells rather than
// renaming into SSA.
